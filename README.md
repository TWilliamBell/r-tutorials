# r-tutorials

These R Tutorials are conceived to be part of a series given for the McMaster Public Health Association.

The topics aren't quite established yet, aside from the first one which covers calculation, subsetting, assignment, comparison (Boolean expressions), the basic vector types (character, integer, double, and logical), and the syntax of writing functions.

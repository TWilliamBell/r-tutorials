# r-tutorials

These R Tutorials are conceived to be part of a series given for the McMaster Peace Studies Praxis course (4G).

The tutorials cover many topics, the first covers calculation, subsetting, assignment, comparison (Boolean expressions), the basic vector types (character, integer, double, and logical), and the syntax of writing functions, the second covers control flow, useful base-R functions, and joins, and the third covers the basics of working with text data (strsplit, paste, grep, grepl, gsub) and sentiment analysis on twitter data.
